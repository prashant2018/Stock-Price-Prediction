## About
The aim of the project was to build a predictive model of market trends for stock predictions using Machine learning and Deep Learning. 
There are a lot of factors such as past prices, sentiment analysis, brand value among others which can be used in harmony to predict the results with a high accuracy rate.
We implemented different algorithms to achieve highest accuracy. We then did a comparative study to determine which algorithm is best suited for stock market prediction.
We trained our machine learning model using data sets consisting of historical data and Google Trends value.

Our model will perform following:
- Take Historical Price & Google Trends
- Visualize the data over a time series.
- Predict the upcoming prices on a range of dates.
